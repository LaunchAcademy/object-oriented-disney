# Disney OOP Livecode With Inheritance

Starter code for a Launch Academy Live Code clinic, covering test-driven object oriented programming in Ruby. Tests including inheritance are marked as pending.

## Setup

To get set up, run `bundle`. From there, run your tests using `rspec`, and let the tests guide your development!

Feel free to remove line 2 of the `.rspec` file to see all tests at once.
